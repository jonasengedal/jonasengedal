# SOLID Principles #

The **SOLID** principles are a set of five guidelines for writing maintainable and scalable object-oriented software. Each principle addresses specific challenges in software design, promoting cleaner, more modular code.

Weekly Dev Tips:

> SOLID principles should generally be applied during the Make It Right step. Don't apply them up front, but as I discussed in Episode 10, follow Pain Driven Development. If you try to apply every principle to every part of your codebase from the start, you'll end up with extremely abstract code that could do anything but actually does nothing.

Weekly Dev Tips:

> ... build the code you need to solve the problem at hand, and then evaluate whether that code has any major code smells ... One huge [code smell](https://weeklydevtips.com/episodes/030) is code that is hard to unit test, meaning it's hard to write an automated test that can just test your code, without any external infrastructure or dependencies like databases, files, or web servers.

## Summary of SOLID Principles ##

1. [**SRP**](#1-single-responsibility-principle-srp): A class should have one and only one reason to change.
2. [**OCP**](#2-openclosed-principle-ocp): Extend functionality without modifying existing code.
3. [**LSP**](#3-liskov-substitution-principle-lsp): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
4. [**ISP**](#4-interface-segregation-principle-isp): Avoid forcing classes to implement irrelevant methods.
5. [**DIP**](#5-dependency-inversion-principle-dip): Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ##

**Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility.

```csharp
// Without SRP: A single class handling both user management and notification
public class UserManager
{
    public void CreateUser(string name)
    {
        // Logic for creating a user
    }

    public void SendEmailNotification(string email, string message)
    {
        // Logic for sending email
    }
}

// With SRP: Separate classes for user management and notification
public class UserManager
{
    public void CreateUser(string name)
    {
        // Logic for creating a user
    }
}

public class EmailNotifier
{
    public void SendEmail(string email, string message)
    {
        // Logic for sending email
    }
}
```

## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ##

**Definition**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

```csharp
// Without OCP: Modifying the class to add new functionality
public class DiscountCalculator
{
    public double CalculateDiscount(string customerType, double totalAmount)
    {
        if (customerType == "Regular")
        {
            return totalAmount * 0.1;
        }
        else if (customerType == "Premium")
        {
            return totalAmount * 0.2;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}

// With OCP: Extending functionality without modifying the existing class
public abstract class Discount
{
    public abstract double Calculate(double totalAmount);
}

public class RegularDiscount : Discount
{
    public override double Calculate(double totalAmount) => totalAmount * 0.1;
}

public class PremiumDiscount : Discount
{
    public override double Calculate(double totalAmount) => totalAmount * 0.2;
}

// Usage:
public class DiscountCalculator
{
    public double CalculateDiscount(Discount discount, double totalAmount)
    {
        return discount.Calculate(totalAmount);
    }
}
```

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ##

**Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

```csharp
// Violating LSP: A subclass alters the behavior in an unexpected way
public class Bird
{
    public virtual void Fly()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Flying");
    }
}

public class Penguin : Bird
{
    public override void Fly()
    {
        throw new NotSupportedException("Penguins can't fly!");
    }
}

// Following LSP: Redesigning the hierarchy
public abstract class Bird
{
    public abstract void Move();
}

public class FlyingBird : Bird
{
    public override void Move()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Flying");
    }
}

public class Penguin : Bird
{
    public override void Move()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Swimming");
    }
}
```

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) ##

**Definition**: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

```csharp
// Without ISP: A large interface that forces unnecessary implementation
public interface IWorker
{
    void Work();
    void Eat();
}

public class Robot : IWorker
{
    public void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Working");
    }

    public void Eat()
    {
        // Robots don't eat, so this method is irrelevant
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}

// With ISP: Splitting the interface
public interface IWorkable
{
    void Work();
}

public interface IEatable
{
    void Eat();
}

public class Human : IWorkable, IEatable
{
    public void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Working");
    }

    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Eating");
    }
}

public class Robot : IWorkable
{
    public void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Working");
    }
}
```

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) ##

**Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

```csharp
// Without DIP: High-level class depends on a low-level implementation
public class EmailService
{
    public void SendEmail(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sending email: {message}");
    }
}

public class Notification
{
    private EmailService _emailService = new EmailService();

    public void Notify(string message)
    {
        _emailService.SendEmail(message);
    }
}

// With DIP: High-level class depends on an abstraction
public interface IMessageService
{
    void SendMessage(string message);
}

public class EmailService : IMessageService
{
    public void SendMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sending email: {message}");
    }
}

public class Notification
{
    private readonly IMessageService _messageService;

    public Notification(IMessageService messageService)
    {
        _messageService = messageService;
    }

    public void Notify(string message)
    {
        _messageService.SendMessage(message);
    }
}

// Usage:
var emailService = new EmailService();
var notification = new Notification(emailService);
notification.Notify("Hello!");
```
