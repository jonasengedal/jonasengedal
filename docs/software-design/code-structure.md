# Code Structure

When structuring .NET APIs, choosing **Vertical/Feature Slices** over a **Functional Structure** can lead to better organization and scalability in certain scenarios. Below is an explanation of the two approaches and the reasons why Vertical/Feature Slices are often preferred:

## Functional Structure

In a **Functional Structure**, code is organized by technical functions or layers, such as Controllers, Services, and Repositories. 

**Example Directory Structure:**

```files
- Controllers/
  - UserController.cs
  - ProductController.cs
- Services/
  - UserService.cs
  - ProductService.cs
- Repositories/
  - UserRepository.cs
  - ProductRepository.cs
```

**Pros:**

- Simple and easy to start for small projects.
- Clear separation of concerns at the technical layer.

**Cons:**

- **Tightly Coupled Layers**: Changes often ripple through multiple layers.
- **Cross-Cutting Features**: Adding a feature requires touching multiple folders, making changes harder to track.
- **Scaling Challenges**: As the project grows, the structure becomes cluttered, with files scattered across layers.

## **Vertical/Feature Slices**

In a **Vertical/Feature Slice** structure, code is organized by feature or business domain, grouping related components together.

**Example Directory Structure:**

```files
- Features/
  - Users/
    - UserController.cs
    - UserService.cs
    - UserRepository.cs
    - UserDto.cs
  - Products/
    - ProductController.cs
    - ProductService.cs
    - ProductRepository.cs
    - ProductDto.cs
```

**Pros:**

1. **Feature-Focused Development**:
   - Each feature is self-contained, making it easier to reason about and manage.
   - Team members can work on separate features with minimal conflicts.

2. **Improved Scalability**:
   - The structure naturally scales with the number of features.
   - New features can be added without affecting the rest of the codebase.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - Each feature encapsulates its own logic, reducing dependencies between features.
   - Easier to refactor or migrate specific features if necessary.

4. **Easier Testing and Maintenance**:
   - Since all components related to a feature are grouped together, debugging and testing are simplified.
   - Changes to a single feature donâ€™t require navigating multiple folders.

5. **Better Collaboration**:
   - Teams can be assigned to specific features rather than technical layers, improving ownership and reducing bottlenecks.

6. **Microservices-Ready**:
   - Encourages a structure that can evolve into microservices if the need arises.
   - Features can be split into separate services without major restructuring.

**Cons:**

- **Initial Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with the structure might need time to adjust.
- **Potential Duplication**: If not managed carefully, common logic might be duplicated across features.

## **Comparison: When to Choose Vertical Slices**

| Aspect                       | Functional Structure       | Vertical/Feature Slices |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Small Projects**           | Easier to implement       | Overhead for simplicity  |
| **Scaling**                  | Harder to scale           | Scales naturally         |
| **Feature Development**      | Touches multiple layers   | Isolated per feature     |
| **Team Collaboration**       | Centralized, high conflict | Decentralized, low conflict |
| **Testing and Maintenance**  | Distributed logic         | Localized per feature    |
| **Refactoring**              | Complex and interdependent | Easier and isolated      |

## **Conclusion**

**Vertical/Feature Slices** are especially advantageous for medium-to-large projects or when working in agile teams where features are added incrementally. By grouping all components of a feature together, this approach improves clarity, maintainability, and scalability. While Functional Structure might be suitable for small or simple projects, adopting Vertical/Feature Slices early can save significant time and effort as the project grows.
